ingame|It's "/ingame".|sl_install|http://springlobby.info/wiki/springlobby/Install|addbot|KAIK will work fine for most if not all the Annihilation mods, if a LuaAI is available ( marked as mod specific AI ) it's warmly suggested to use that instead
If the bot is too hard to beat, give yourself some resource bonus, if it's too easy, add more than one an/or give the mentioned bonus to the bots|lobby_reload|map/mod list can be reloaded in various ways: for TASClient users, click on the host battle button
for SpringLobby users, it can be accessed from the tools->Reload map/mod list button
both lobbies can also reload the list by the button inside an empty minimap preview|gl_arb|This error can be caused by various things: 1. Old video Hardware.   2. Old drivers.  3. Bad installed Drivers. 4. Bad game settings.

in the case it fails, you can still manually download the required files from the sites linked in the #newbies topic
files downloaded that way need to be moved to the spring datadir to be installed( use !faq datadir for more infos ) and a lobby list reload might be necessary ( use !faq lobby_reload for more infos )|broken_datadir|If you get errors such as ''could not parse : 'gamedata/parse_tdf.lua'", it means that either your spring content installation is being broken or cannot be found
first of all search for all instances of springcontent.sdz in all spring data subfolders BUT skip the folder where spring is installed to ( use !faq datadir for a list of possible folders )
if you're using windows vista/windows7 with the uac on and the problem persists after trying the first step, reinstalling spring to a location other than program files fixes it|startplay|You'll need both a map & a mod(game) to play, both can be downloaded directly by trying to join a game on the list
A good way to start learning is to spectate ( join a game and select the spectator button) some battle or play a singleplayer game and add a bot
for more informations, use !faq mod or !faq addbot or !faq download|paste|If you need to upload some text, such as an infolog.txt, some other file, or any text longer than 3 lines, use a service such as http://pastebin.com/ or http://www.pastey.net/ and post the link to the generated file here.|mod|Spring is just an engine, alone it won't do much, mods are games that run on the engine
you can download them either from the integrated downloader or from the urls in the #newbies topic
